# 3. Overview of cryptographic failures

## [https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/][website]

So cryptographic failures occur when applications improperly implement or manage cryptographic processes, leading to vulnerabilities that can expose sensitive data to unauthorized access.\
Common issues include using outdated or weak encryption algorithms, improper key management is big one, and transmitting data without encryption.\
These failures can result in data breaches, identity theft, and other security incidents.
